<table align="left"> <p> <font color="green">Education is very important for every child whether boy or girl. It is
sad that some communities still discriminate against the education of
the girl child. <br>
About 57million children around the world are not
going to school. The report, Children Still Battling to go to School,
finds that 95% of the 28.5 million <br> 
children not getting a primary
school education live in low and lower-middle income countries 44%
in sub-Saharan Africa, 19% in south and west Asia <br> 
and 14%  in the Arab states, UNESCO said. Girls make up 55% of the total and were often the
victims of rape and other sexual violence that accompanies <br> armed
conflicts, UNESCO said. As the world celebrates Malala birthday let
us look at some of the reasons why girls should get an education.</font> <br><br>
<font color="blue"> <b>1.EDUCATED FUTURE GENERATIONS :</b> </font> <font color="green"> An African proverb says, "If we
educate a boy, we educate one person. If we educate a girl, we educate 
a <br> 
 family - and a whole nation."
By sending a girl to school, she is
far more likely to ensure that her children also receive an education. 
As many claim, <br>
 investing in a girl's education is investing in a
nation. <br><br> <font color="green">
<font color="blue"> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.DECREASE INFANT MORTALITY:  </b> </font> Children of educated women are less
likely to die before their first birthday. Girls who receive an
education are less likely <br>  contact HIV & AIDS, and thus,less likely
to pass it onto their children. Primary education alone helps reduce
infant mortality significantly, and secondary education  <br> helps even
more. The Girls Global Education Fund reports that when a child is
born to a woman in Africa who hasn't received an education, he or she
has a <br>  1 in 5 chance of dying before 5.
 <br> <br> 
<font color="blue"> <b> 3.DECREASE MATERNAL MORTALITY:  </b> </font> Educated women (with greater knowledge
of health care and fewer pregnancies) are less likely to die during
pregnancy, <br> 
childbirth, or during the postpartum period. Increased
education of girls also leads to more female health care providers to
assist with prenatal medical care, labor  <br> 
and delivery, delivery
complications and emergencies, and follow-up care.<br>
I am thankful to all those who supported in the working of this institution. I will always be obeliged to them for their co-operation.
