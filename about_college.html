he saw the plight of girls and worried about their education.On that time there were no any proper platform for females educations, so he  <br> 
thought to give a good platform to the girls by making an special institution for them.He set up an instituion specially for girls named as "Nagendra Jha Mahila <br>
 College".He ,intially, started the institution from five to six rooms. There were no proper infrastructure and facilities. <br>
It emphasis on life skill activities, providing
students an edge over others to be leaders in their respective field
of activity. Through life skills programme,<br> 
the school aims to, develop
a cadre of empowered, educated and healthy adolescents, capable of
making decisions in life.

(Late Lakhrajo Devi).
