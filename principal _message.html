 Our philosophy of education has always been meeting the needs of the
individual child. Children acquire skills and knowledge easily if we
can make the <br> 
surroundings stimulating and purposeful. In the 21st
century, the digital revolution has affected us all. Quite simply, it
is changing everything: a brilliant <br> 
barrage of information,entertainment, companionship and education is speedily available. In
this era of cut throat competition, it is of paramount importance<br>
 to impart an integrated education to the future citizens of the nation
for successfully facing challenges. Bal Bharati Public School,
therefore, lays special <br>
 emphasis on life skill activities, providing
students an edge over others to be leaders in their respective field
of activity. Through life skills programme,<br> 
the school aims to, develop
a cadre of empowered, educated and healthy adolescents, capable of
making decisions in life.</p>
<p> In addition students are encouraged to take advantage of the many
resources available to them- their teachers, the library, the computer
labs, and the <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technology enabled smart classes. Our sports facilities
provide our students the launching pad to hone their talents and make
a mark in a variety of sport <br>
 disciplines. Our commitment is to provide a safe, positive, intellectual learning
environment that will empower students to become creative problem
solvers, <br> 
thinkers and inspired learners prepared for life in the
twenty-first century. I would like to continue setting high
expectations for our students with regard to <br> academic performance
within the classroom, participation in co-curricular activities as
well as responsible citizenship at school and in the community.<br>
The Child Education Society promotes schools which recognize that
parents are the first educators of the children. Schools run by the
Society, help parents<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this all-important task. My appeal to Parents
is to please make time to ask your ward specific questions about their
time at school. Send in your feedback <br>
and keep abreast of relevant
information regarding your child's performance. Your interest and
concern in the school progress will motivate them to do their best.<br><br>
Communicate with your child's teachers and staff members to establish
a successful home/school connection. Parents, please help us by
reinforcing school <br>expectations at home. With your help, we will
continue to be a school community in which every person feels
respected, valued, and is encouraged and <br>
challenged to achieve the
highest levels. </font>
